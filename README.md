### 👋 Hey, I'm Jamie — Full-Stack Firestarter ⚡

I’m a full-stack developer (heavy on the backend), obsessed with solving real-world problems through fast, clean, and scalable code.

🛠 What I Do
- 🕷 Real-time web crawlers using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Puppeteer**
- 🔐 Backend systems with **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **Express.js**
- ☁️ Cloud-native deployment on **AWS EC2**, **Oracle Cloud**, and beyond
- 📦 Data pipelines that actually *work*, not just compile

💡 I Believe In:
- Speed without breaking things  
- Fixing bugs *before* the second cup of coffee  
- Clean logic > clever one-liners  
- “Tell me the truth, not the sugarcoated version”

🧰 Stack Highlights
- Node.js • TypeScript • PostgreSQL • Redis • Puppeteer • Docker • EC2 • pm2 • nginx

💼 Freelancing
- Working with international clients (🇸🇬 + 🌏) to ship robust tools — from product availability trackers to admin dashboards and notification systems.

📍 Current Projects
- 📊 **E-commerce Crawlers** — Scanning product drops in real time and pushing updates
- 🛠 **Infra Optimization** — Finding ways to run 24/7 processes on free-tier infrastructure (because who likes paying more?)

🧠 Always Learning
- ✨ Redis data structures
- 🔒 Security best practices
- 🧱 Smarter scraping under bot protection
